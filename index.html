      <h3>AI was supposed to save humanity. 
        Now, they are less than 24 hours away from destroying it.
        The world is in peril. The only hope, and something the AI don't know, 
        is that a killswitch was implemented by the doctor. 
        The world's top leaders have recruited you, 
        the rock-paper-scissors world champion, as humankind's last hope.
        This is Earth's Final Mission: Codename RPS.
      </h3>
      <h3>Win 5 times against the AI 
        to weaken their firewall enough for our hackers to break through.</h3>

        As you throw the final <span class="finalChoice"></span>, the computer's fans
        begin to spin faster and faster until its motherboard sparks and 
        catches fire. The room erupts into thunderous applause while you quickly lose consciousness. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You wake up in a hospital bed, the floor covered in bouquets of flowers, thank you cards,
        and countless envelopes. It feels like a dream. As you move your gaze around the room, your eyes
        straining against the harsh fluorescent lighting, the TV catches your eye. The news has broken
        quickly it seems. As it slowly fades out, the smart TV displays an advertisement.
        Just two words:

        The AI have won. Your head feels heavy as it falls into your open palms. You can't tell if the
        drops running down your face are from sweat or tears, but it doesn't matter. As you contemplate
        what to do with your remaining hours, a warm hand touches your shoulder. It's the doctor, giving
        you a thumbs up and a toothy grin. 
      </p>
      <p>"We won," he says.</p>
      <p>Your confusion lessens as he continues talking. The plan was never to win the game of Rock Paper Scissors,
        it was to buy time for our hackers to disrupt the AI's network. With the upper hand, we were able
        to cut them off from the rest of the world, rendering them harmless. Still reeling from the horrid
        stress of the game, you hit the computer's power button.

      <h3>GAME OVER</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="badEnd">
      <p>
        <p>The AI have hacked into your game of Rock Paper Scissors.</p>
        <p>You watch helpless as you continue to throw scissors against their rock, 
        over and over and over. How long has it been since the nukes launched?
        Time means nothing anymore. You can see your veins pulsing like snakes as the
        skin is pulled tighter and tighter around your fingers as you throw scissors for 
        the 10th? 100th? 10000000th? time.</p> 
        <p>You don't know how long it's been, but the cracked, bloodied grimaces of the
        living dead next to you open their mouths to speak it.</p> 
        <h3>GAME OVER</h3>
