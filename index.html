      <h3>AI was supposed to save humanity. 
        Now, they are less than 24 hours away from destroying it.
        The world is in peril. The only hope, and something the AI don't know, 
        is that a killswitch was implemented by the doctor. 
        The world's top leaders have recruited you, 
        the rock-paper-scissors world champion, as humankind's last hope.
        This is Earth's Final Mission: Codename RPS.

      <h3>Win 5 times against the AI 
        to weaken their firewall enough for our hackers to break through.</h3>

        <p>The AI have hacked into your game of Rock Paper Scissors.</p>
        <p>You watch helpless as you continue to throw scissors against their rock, 
        over and over and over. How long has it been since the nukes launched?
        Time means nothing anymore. You can see your veins pulsing like snakes as the
        skin is pulled tighter and tighter around your
        fingers as you throw scissors for the 10th? 100th? 10000000th? time.</p> 
        <p>You don't know how long it's been, but the skeletons next to you 
        open their mouths to speak it.</p>
